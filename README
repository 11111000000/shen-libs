This is a repository of experimental Shen libraries.

Shen is modern rapidly developing programming language (more preciesely - 
metalanguage) created by Dr. Mark Tarver for all modern platforms (Python, 
JavaScript, Scheme, Common Lisp and many others).
It combines functional programming, pattern-matching, compiler-compiler, 
declarative programming (almost one-to-one as in prolog) and most powerful 
type system in one single, comact and crossplatform core.
You may found more inforamtion about it on site http://www.lambdassociates.org

If you want to share your code with other Shen users then write to

Your patches, suggestions, remarks are always wellcome.
